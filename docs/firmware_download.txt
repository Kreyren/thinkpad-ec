This is a list of the Lenovo pages that can be checked to find possible BIOS
and EC updates.  It is not completely clear if Lenovo publishes all new
versions to the same page URL, so these may not link to the latest software,
but they will provide a reasonable starting point for any search for the
latest versions.

These pages provide the the description, checksum and binaries for the
bootable BIOS update CD images for both the current and historical releases.
